	<p><font size="5" face="Times" color="black">For centuries, the primary purpose of eyeglasses has been to improve our vision to 20/20. But now as the year 2021 arrives, eyeglass<span style="color:red"> makers</span> and internet pioneers are joining forces to make our one-trick-pony glasses smarter as well.<br>what in the world are smart glasses? Simply put,they are an attempt to bring the wireless connectivity and imaging we enjoy on our home computers and cellphones into the frames and lenses of our eyewear.<br>Just as we can no longer imagine living without a laptop or mobile phone,soon we may enjoy the same versatility and connectivity from our eyeglasses, and even our contact lenses.Quite eye-opener,wouldn't you say?</font></p></article>

	<p><font size="5" face="Times" color="black"><b>1.sound:</b> The speaker for wireless audio inputs and cellphone reception rests on the end of the ear rest(s).Audio is transferred to the ear via bone conduction instead of air conduction through the audio canal.</p>
	<p><b>2.Smarts:</b> The central processing unit (<sub>C</sub><sup>P</sup><sub>U</sub>)computer brain is situated on the arm of one ear rest.</p>
	<p><b>3.Mic:</b>The microphone for cellphone conversations and hands-free voice searchs is perched under one hinge. Most smart glasses today pair the microphone with a micro speaker for audio feedback and notificationsl, as well as to listen to music and podcast.</p>
	<p><b>4.Projector and prism:</b>Located above the upper part of the lens,this projection method, called curved mirror or curved mirror combiner,offers partically transparent digital displays without obscuring the real-world view.Some manufacturers now offer an altinative version called <i>waveguide holographic</i> optics.The digital overlay of text and images within our field of view is the key that unlocks the smart glasses experience</p>
	<p><b>5.Camera:</b>While an obvious feature in our selfie age, the <mark>cemera</mark> lens at the temple of the Google Glasses brought with it an unintended new experience:privacy concerns.Many onlookers weren't thrilled to in essence be filmed and saved may have hastened Explorer's departure.While smart manufacturers now make cemera lenses small enough to fit inconspicuously inside the frame of their products,a few, including Focals by North and Vue,now offer cemera-less models.</font></p></article>
